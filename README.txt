Work that hasn't been done yet:

- Test and make the notifications work fully. There are still some bugs in the console. 

- Make the UI for the notifications page (when we click on the bell and then on "see all >>"). I was thinking of sorting the notifications by notification type, time and maybe somehow importance.

- The UI of the documents view needs improvement. We decided that in every view requiring to list and display, the list would be on the left and the display on the right for consistency through the website.

- The UI of the Educational material can probably be improved a bit. Checking the app would be a good thing to do to stay consistent between the portal and the app (it is accessible by googling "depdocs opal").
  The functionality of the educational material is already the same as in the app.

- Find and download or grab from the database .png formats for all the images on the portal, i.e. the logos, the doctors' profile picture, etc.

- Use Json objects to allow the user to choose between French and English.

- CSS details. Try to correct every bug that arises in the UI to make the navigation of the website pleasant and intuitive.

- Consult John and Laurie to see what is in the core of the web portal. The messages aren't a priority. 

- Solve the loading problem, i.e. download the content page by page using the controllers for each view as the user navigates the site,
 instead of loading the whole website each time one refreshes a page.

 - Make sure all the submit buttons in the user settings work.
